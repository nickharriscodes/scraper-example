# Ninja Scraper

This is a very basic example of a web scraper. It targets a very specific domain, gets the HTML using Axios, parses it using Cheerio, and then can notify the user of the result of the scrape using Nodemailer.

## Local Usage

Run

`npm install`

Then, either set your environment variables in a .bashrc or .bash_profile, or simply hardcode your email authentication information into scraper.js.

Then

`npm run start`
